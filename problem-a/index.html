        <p>Monkey D. Luffy, commonly known as Strawhat Luffy is the Captain of the Strawhat pirates, one of the strongest pirate crews in the current <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Piece">One Piece</a></cite> world. He desires to find the hidden treasure, the One Piece, left behind by the past King of the Pirates, Gol D. Roger. He was inspired to become a pirate and pursue this treasure by Shanks, who is also a reknowned and powerful pirate. His dream is to become the next King of the Pirates, making him the most free person in the world. Although alot of the pirates in this world are evil, the Strawhat Pirates are a group that does not conform to that idea and often helps people in need.</p>
        <p>Some of the reasons why I admire this character:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="silly">Can eat alot of food</li>
            <li>Once he recognizes someone as his friend, he will always have their back</li>
            <li>Does whatever he wants whenever he wants</li>
        </ul>
